# Wireshark Tutorial for Beginners

Wireshark is an essential tool for network professionals, providing detailed insight into network traffic. This tutorial aims to guide beginners through the foundational aspects of Wireshark, enabling effective analysis of network trace files. It will focus on the critical setup and customization features within Wireshark, using precise terminology and accurate instructions.

## Introduction to Wireshark Setup

Wireshark, at its core, is a packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and more. The interface, while initially overwhelming, becomes intuitive with proper configuration. A key aspect of this setup involves understanding and utilizing Wireshark profiles.

### Understanding Wireshark Profiles

A Wireshark profile is a customizable set of settings tailored to specific needs or protocols. Similar to how different drivers adjust their car seat, steering wheel, and mirrors for optimal comfort, a Wireshark profile allows you to configure settings like columns, filters, and coloring rules to fit the particular protocol or analysis you are working on.

#### Creating and Managing Profiles

To create a new profile:

1. **Access the Profile Management**: In the lower right-hand corner of the Wireshark interface, you can see the active profile. Right-click this area to manage your profiles.
2. **Create a New Profile**: Select the option to create a new profile, name it appropriately (e.g., "Wireshark Master Class"), and save it. This profile now becomes your active profile, and any changes you make will be saved under this configuration.

### Customizing the Interface

Once your profile is set, you should customize the interface to enhance readability and focus on relevant data. This includes adjusting the text size, modifying column widths, and setting up the layout of panes.

1. **Adjusting Text Size**: If the default text size is too small, use the magnifying glass icon or navigate to the preferences to increase the font size.
2. **Configuring Columns**: Ensure columns are clearly visible and not overlapping by adjusting their widths. If necessary, use the column adjuster tool to automatically resize them.

### Pane Layout Customization

Wireshark allows customization of how panes are displayed. This is particularly useful when working on large monitors or when focusing on specific data within packets.

1. **Access Preferences**: Go to `Edit > Preferences` (Windows) or `Wireshark > Preferences` (macOS).
2. **Customize Pane Layout**: Under the "Layout" section, choose how to stack the packet list, packet details, and packet bytes panes. The second option is typically recommended for most users, offering a balanced view of all essential data.

### Packet Diagram Feature

In recent versions of Wireshark, a packet diagram feature was introduced, providing a visual representation of the protocol layers within a packet. This feature is especially beneficial for understanding the encapsulation of protocols within each packet.

To enable this:

1. **Select Packet Diagram**: Within the preferences under "Layout," select the "Packet Diagram" option for one of the panes.
2. **Review Protocol Encapsulation**: The diagram will display the Ethernet, IP, and TCP layers (or other protocols depending on the packet), with field values pulled directly from the packet data.

### Column Customization

Columns are a vital aspect of Wireshark as they allow you to quickly see and analyze specific data fields across all packets in a trace. Custom columns can be added based on your needs.

#### Adding a Delta Time Column

A critical column for troubleshooting is the "Delta Time" column, which shows the time difference between successive packets.

1. **Add a Delta Time Column**:
   - Navigate to `Edit > Preferences > Columns`.
   - Click the plus icon to add a new column.
   - Name the column "Delta" and set its type to "Delta time displayed".
   - Position this column next to the existing time column for better correlation of packet timings.

2. **Customize Time Display**:
   - You can adjust how time is represented in the time column by going to `View > Time Display Format`. Options include UTC, time of day, or seconds since the start of capture, depending on your analysis needs.

### Coloring Rules

Wireshark's coloring rules allow packets that meet specific criteria to be highlighted, making anomalies or points of interest immediately visible.

1. **Creating a New Coloring Rule**:
   - Go to `View > Coloring Rules`.
   - Add a new rule by clicking the plus icon, then define the rule with a filter expression, such as `tcp.flags.syn == 1` to highlight TCP SYN packets.
   - Choose a background color (e.g., green for SYN packets) and apply the rule.

2. **Prioritize Coloring Rules**:
   - Arrange the order of coloring rules by dragging them up or down in the list. For example, position the SYN coloring rule below the "Bad TCP" rule so that retransmissions are highlighted differently.

### Filter Buttons

Filter buttons streamline the process of applying common filters without retyping the filter expression each time.

1. **Create a Filter Button**:
   - Apply a filter (e.g., `tcp.flags.syn == 1`) and verify it shows the correct packets.
   - Click the plus icon in the filter bar to save this filter as a button, labeling it appropriately (e.g., "TCP SYN").
   - This button will now be available for one-click filtering in any loaded trace.

### Adding Columns via Right-Click

While columns can be manually added through preferences, a more efficient method involves directly creating columns from packet details.

1. **Add Columns On-the-Fly**:
   - Right-click a field in the packet details pane (e.g., TCP segment length) and select `Apply as Column`.
   - This new column will immediately appear in the packet list pane, displaying relevant data for all packets.

### Summary of Key Lessons

In this tutorial, we covered the following essential setup and customization techniques within Wireshark:

- Creating and managing profiles.
- Adjusting text size and column widths.
- Customizing pane layouts and utilizing the packet diagram feature.
- Adding and configuring columns, including the delta time column.
- Creating and prioritizing coloring rules for better packet visibility.
- Creating filter buttons for quick access to commonly used filters.
- Adding columns directly from packet details.

This foundation prepares you for more advanced analysis and efficient troubleshooting with Wireshark. Each customization step tailors the tool to your specific needs, ensuring that critical information is presented clearly and effectively.
