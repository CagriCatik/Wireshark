# Capturing Packets with Dumpcap

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will delve into the command-line tools available in Wireshark, specifically focusing on capturing network packets using `dumpcap`. Understanding how to use command-line tools is essential for scenarios where the graphical user interface (GUI) of Wireshark may not be ideal, such as remote systems, headless environments, or when scripting automated tasks. This tutorial will guide you through accessing these tools on both Windows and macOS, configuring your system paths, and utilizing various `dumpcap` options to capture and manage network traffic.

## Command-Line Tools Overview

When Wireshark is installed, several command-line tools are included. Among these are:

- **dumpcap**: Captures network traffic and saves it to a file.
- **tshark**: A network protocol analyzer that displays and saves packet data in human-readable form.
- **mergecap**: Merges multiple capture files into one.
- **editcap**: Modifies capture files, such as cutting packets or splitting files.

In this lesson, our focus will be on `dumpcap` due to its efficient packet capturing capabilities, which make it more suitable for high-throughput environments compared to the GUI.

## Accessing Command-Line Tools

### Windows

To access command-line tools on a Windows system:

1. **Open the Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to the Wireshark Directory**:
   - If Wireshark's directory is not added to your system's `PATH` environment variable, you'll need to navigate to it manually. For instance:

     ```sh
     cd "C:\Program Files\Wireshark"
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can add Wireshark's directory to your `PATH` environment variable to access these tools globally:
     - Open Control Panel > System and Security > System.
     - Click on **Advanced system settings**.
     - In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables**.
     - Under **System variables**, select `Path`, and click **Edit**.
     - Add the Wireshark directory path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Wireshark`).

3. **Verify Access**:
   - Once the path is set, you can type `dumpcap -h` in any command prompt to verify that the tools are accessible.

### macOS

On macOS, the process is similar but involves the Terminal:

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - You can find Terminal in `Applications > Utilities` or by using Spotlight search (`Cmd + Space`).

2. **Locate Wireshark Tools**:
   - The Wireshark tools are typically installed in:

     ```sh
     /Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/
     ```

3. **Modify the Path**:
   - Temporarily add the directory to your path:

     ```sh
     export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Wireshark.app/Contents/MacOS/
     ```

   - To make this change permanent, you can add the above line to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell configuration file.

4. **Verify Access**:
   - Test by typing `dumpcap -h` to ensure the tools are properly accessible from the command line.

## Using Dumpcap to Capture Packets

### Basic Usage

To begin capturing packets using `dumpcap`, follow these steps:

1. **List Network Interfaces**:
   - Before capturing, it's crucial to know which network interface you want to monitor. Use the `-D` option to list all available interfaces:

     ```sh
     dumpcap -D
     ```

   - This command will return a list of interfaces with their corresponding index numbers, which you'll use in subsequent commands.

2. **Start a Basic Capture**:
   - To start capturing on a specific interface (e.g., interface 1):

     ```sh
     dumpcap -i 1
     ```

   - By default, `dumpcap` will start capturing packets and saving them to a temporary directory. You can stop the capture by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

### Saving Captures to a Specific Location

To specify where the capture files should be saved:

1. **Specify Output File**:
   - Use the `-w` option to define the path and filename for the output:

     ```sh
     dumpcap -i 1 -w /Users/username/data/sample.pcapng
     ```

2. **Confirm Capture**:
   - Upon running this command, `dumpcap` will save the captured packets to the specified file. The capture will continue until manually stopped with `Ctrl + C`.

### Using Ring Buffers

For long-duration captures or high-traffic environments, a ring buffer is advantageous as it prevents the capture file from growing too large. It splits the capture into smaller, manageable files.

1. **Configure Ring Buffer**:
   - Use the `-b` option to set the file size and number of files in the buffer:

     ```sh
     dumpcap -i 1 -w /Users/username/data/sample.pcapng -b filesize:500000 -b files:10
     ```

   - In this example:
     - `filesize:500000` specifies a maximum file size of 500MB per file.
     - `files:10` limits the number of files to 10, after which older files will be overwritten.

2. **Monitor Ring Buffer Operation**:
   - As `dumpcap` runs, it creates new files as the data grows. Once the limit is reached, the oldest files are overwritten, ensuring that you always have the most recent data without exceeding disk space.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has provided a detailed guide on how to utilize `dumpcap` for packet capturing via the command line. The use of command-line tools like `dumpcap` offers greater flexibility and efficiency, particularly in environments where GUI tools may be less practical. Understanding and using these tools is crucial for network analysis, troubleshooting, and security assessments.

By following the instructions outlined in this lesson, you should now be equipped to capture, manage, and analyze network traffic using Wireshark's command-line utilities in a variety of environments.
