# Name Resolution

In this tutorial, we will explore the functionality of name resolution within Wireshark, a critical feature for network analysis. Name resolution allows Wireshark to display more human-readable names instead of raw numeric values like IP addresses or TCP port numbers. This tutorial will guide you through the process of configuring and utilizing name resolution in Wireshark, highlighting both its advantages and potential complexities. 

## Introduction to Name Resolution in Wireshark

When analyzing network traffic, it is often challenging to identify meaningful information from raw IP addresses and port numbers. Name resolution simplifies this process by mapping these numerical identifiers to more recognizable names, such as domain names or service identifiers. Wireshark provides several options for name resolution, including resolving MAC addresses, transport names, and IP addresses. Each of these can be configured to suit the specific needs of your analysis.

### Accessing Wireshark Preferences

To configure name resolution in Wireshark, begin by accessing the preferences dialog:

- **On Windows:** Go to `Edit > Preferences`.
- **On macOS:** Go to `Wireshark > Preferences`.

Within the preferences window, navigate to the `Name Resolution` section. This section contains various options that control how Wireshark resolves names at different layers of the network stack.

### MAC Address Resolution

The first option under `Name Resolution` is for resolving MAC addresses. MAC addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces, and resolving them to human-readable names can help identify the manufacturer of a device, providing context during analysis.

1. **Enable MAC Address Resolution:**
   - Check the `Resolve MAC Addresses` option.
   - This will translate the hexadecimal MAC addresses into names, such as the manufacturer’s name.

2. **Example:**
   - With MAC address resolution enabled, a MAC address like `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` could be displayed as `Cisco Systems`, providing immediate context about the device's origin.

### Transport Name Resolution

Transport name resolution maps transport-layer port numbers (e.g., TCP or UDP ports) to service names. This is useful for quickly identifying the purpose of a given connection, such as distinguishing web traffic (port 80 or 443) from other types of traffic.

1. **Enable Transport Name Resolution:**
   - Check the `Resolve Transport Names` option.
   - Wireshark will map common port numbers to their respective service names (e.g., `443` will be resolved to `HTTPS`).

2. **Example:**
   - With this option enabled, a connection using port `443` will be labeled as `HTTPS`, making it clear that the traffic is likely related to secure web browsing.

### IP Address Resolution

IP address resolution maps IP addresses to domain names. This is perhaps the most useful form of name resolution, as it can replace cryptic IP addresses with domain names that are easier to interpret.

1. **Enable IP Address Resolution:**
   - Check the `Resolve Network (IP) Addresses` option.
   - Wireshark will attempt to map IP addresses to domain names using a variety of methods.

2. **Resolution Methods:**
   - **Capture File DNS Data:** If DNS queries and responses are captured within the trace file, Wireshark can use this information to resolve IP addresses.
   - **System DNS Resolver:** If no DNS information is found within the trace file, Wireshark can query external DNS servers to resolve IP addresses. By default, it will use the system's configured DNS servers, but you can specify custom DNS servers.

3. **Example:**
   - An IP address like `142.250.191.78` might be resolved to `google.com`, providing immediate recognition of the traffic's destination.

### Configuring Custom DNS Servers

Wireshark allows you to specify custom DNS servers for name resolution. This is useful in environments where specific DNS resolvers are required, such as when analyzing traffic in an isolated network or when the default system DNS servers do not provide adequate resolution.

1. **Specify Custom DNS Servers:**
   - In the `DNS Servers` section of the `Name Resolution` preferences, click `Edit`.
   - Add the desired DNS servers to the list.

2. **Impact on Analysis:**
   - Using custom DNS servers can enhance the accuracy and relevance of name resolution, particularly when analyzing traffic related to specific domains or in controlled environments.

### Viewing and Managing Resolved Addresses

After enabling and configuring name resolution, Wireshark provides tools to view and manage the resolved addresses within your trace files.

1. **View Resolved Addresses:**
   - Navigate to `Statistics > Resolved Addresses`.
   - Here, you can view a list of all resolved MAC, transport, and network addresses within the current trace file.

2. **Managing Resolved Names:**
   - You can manually edit resolved names by right-clicking on an address and selecting `Edit Resolved Name`.
   - This feature allows you to assign meaningful names to IP addresses within your trace, improving clarity for subsequent analysis.

3. **Persistence of Resolved Names:**
   - If you save the trace file in the `pcapng` format, Wireshark will include the name resolution information within the file.
   - This ensures that when the file is opened by another user or on a different system, the resolved names are retained, reducing the need for additional DNS queries.

### Example Workflow

Let's illustrate the use of name resolution with a practical example:

1. **Start by Capturing or Loading a Trace File:**
   - Open Wireshark and either start capturing live traffic or load an existing trace file.

2. **Enable Name Resolution:**
   - Ensure that `Resolve Network (IP) Addresses` is enabled in the preferences.

3. **Analyze Traffic:**
   - Use the resolved names to identify the sources and destinations of the traffic in your capture.
   - For example, instead of seeing raw IP addresses, you might see names like `google.com` or `gateway`.

4. **Edit Resolved Names as Needed:**
   - If you encounter an IP address that has not been resolved, manually assign it a name by right-clicking and selecting `Edit Resolved Name`.

5. **Save the Trace File:**
   - Save the file in `pcapng` format to preserve the name resolution data.

6. **Share the Trace File:**
   - When sharing the file with others, they will benefit from the same name resolution data, improving their ability to analyze the traffic without additional configuration.

### Conclusion

Name resolution is a powerful feature in Wireshark that can significantly enhance the readability and usability of network traffic data. By converting raw IP addresses, MAC addresses, and port numbers into meaningful names, analysts can quickly gain insights into the nature of the traffic they are examining. However, it is essential to configure name resolution settings carefully to balance the benefits of name resolution with the potential overhead of additional DNS queries. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can optimize your use of Wireshark’s name resolution features to facilitate more effective network analysis.
